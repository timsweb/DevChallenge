# Tim's Recruitment challenge

Start by cloning this repository. Then install the dependenices using composer. Composer isn't part of this codebase, so if you don't already have it installed you will need to download it. 

    php composer.phar install

Once that's done, this should be runable using PHP's built in http server. From the project root you can:

    php -S localhost:8080 -t ./public/

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). The home page will have more deatailed insturctions on what to do next, but a quick summary is that there is some incomplete throttling code that needs implementing.
